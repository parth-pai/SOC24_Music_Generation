# SOC24_Music_Generation
This will contain my final codes for melody generation soc. Here by collaborating with other co-mentees, we managed to create a music generation engine using LSTM models and various music libraries like music21. first we preprocessed the data on the deutsch files and then trained the LSTM model using these files and then generated the melody using a seed file. All the relevant codes are uploaded in the github link here. Thanks!
